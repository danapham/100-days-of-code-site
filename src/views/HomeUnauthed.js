      <p>Dana and I are enrolled in Nashville Software School's Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. As we inch closer and closer towards graduation, the job hunt jitters grow stronger. The call to succumb to imposter syndrome grows louder. In order to combat this, we decided to build a simple application capturing our personal journeys to 100 days of coding.
